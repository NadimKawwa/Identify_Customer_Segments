# Identify_Customer_Segments

Apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany.
We will look at relationships between demographics features, organize the population into clusters, and see how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained.


# The Dataset

The datasets used here are provided coutesy of Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions.

Unfourtunately the datasets are proprietary of AZ Direct GmbH and can't be shared on this repository.
Users interested in using the datasets should contact AZ Direct, or enroll in Udacity's Data Sciecne Nanodegree for an opporunity to work with it.
That being said, the methods used here cam be applied to any unsupervised learning project.
You can also read observations in the notebook to get a sense of what is in the dataset ;).
